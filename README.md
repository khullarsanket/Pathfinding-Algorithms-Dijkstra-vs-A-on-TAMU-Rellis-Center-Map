# Pathfinding-Algorithms-Dijkstra-vs-A-on-TAMU-Rellis-Center-Map

## Project Overview

This project presents a detailed comparison of two fundamental pathfinding algorithms, Dijkstra and A*, using a custom-created occupancy grid based on the layout of the TAMU Rellis Center. It aims to investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of each algorithm in navigating complex environments.

## Objectives

- To compare the performance of Dijkstra and A* algorithms in terms of path optimality and computational efficiency.
- To understand the influence of environmental complexity, represented by the TAMU Rellis Center's layout, on algorithm performance.

## Approach

The study employs a manually created occupancy grid map that reflects the intricate pathways and obstacles of the TAMU Rellis Center. It benchmarks the Dijkstra and A* algorithms' performance across various scenarios within this environment.

## Key Findings

- The A* algorithm demonstrates superior efficiency over Dijkstra, particularly in complex environments, due to its heuristic-driven search.
- Both algorithms reliably identify optimal paths, underscoring their applicability in real-world navigation tasks.

## Repository Content

- `occupancy_grid_maps/`: Custom occupancy grid maps of the TAMU Rellis Center.
- `analysis/`: Comparative analysis reports detailing findings and insights.
- `source_code/`: Implementation code for both pathfinding algorithms.

## Conclusion

This comparative study highlights the nuanced differences between Dijkstra and A* algorithms in pathfinding, with A* showing notable advantages in complex mapping scenarios like the TAMU Rellis Center's layout.
